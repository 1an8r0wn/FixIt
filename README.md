> **FixIt** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on the original [LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) and [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt).

[LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) is a awesome hugo theme for us, I'm sorry that it's repository has been out of maintenance for a long time, so I rebuilt a new fork named FixIt so that I can better Fix it and make it more user-friendly.

The FixIt theme inherits the excellent functions of these themes, and adds new functions and optimizations on this basis. Please read [Why Choose FixIt](#why-choose-fixit) to learn more.
